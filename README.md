[Hello Spiffy Node](http://www.spiffyui.org) - beautiful, fast, maintainable applications with GWT and REST
==================================================

Hello Spiffy Node is a sample application using the [Spiffy UI Framework](http://www.spiffyui.org) which builds a simple REST application with Apache Ant and runs on Node.js.


Building and Running Spiffy UI
--------------------------------------

HelloSpiffyNode is built with Apache Ant using Apache Ivy and deployed to Node.js.  Once you've installed Ant with Ivy and Node.js, go to your HelloSpiffyNode working copy and run these commands:

        <ANT_HOME>/ant
        <NODE_HOME>/node HelloSpiffyNode.js
        
The ant command will download the required libraries and build the Hello Spiffy Node project.  The node command will start the server once the build is complete and provide instructions for accessing the running application.
